## Built With 

I do not use any framework with this, this can be done with the just HTML and CSS.

## Future Plans 

I made this project based on Front End Mentor and well it doesn't require updates except for any revision to the files that are impractical and can be done better, but this is my approach to the project but I'm not the most skillful person in this thing, so you might see some things that are not well planned.

And as a part of it, you can create a issue in this repository so I can review this and make changes if needed .

## README.md

This readme.md file is based on the README-template.md of the Front End Mentor starter files. I made this template from scrath with the use of the template file.

This is just a simple file to explain some things that I want to highlight, this is the most detailed thing that you may read but I hope it will do the thing.
